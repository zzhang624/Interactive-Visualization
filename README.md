Summarize the data by displaying the count of earthquakes by region for each year and show the sum of earthquakes by year for all states in their respective regions. 

Axes: All axes should automatically adjust based on the data. Do not hard-code any values.

The vertical axis will represent the total count of earthquakes for a region. Display these values using a linear scale.
The horizontal axis will represent the years. Display these values using a time scale.

## Interactivity and sub-chart. 
When hovering over a dot, a horizontal bar chart representing the earthquake count for each state in a region will be shown below the line chart (for the year of that dot). For example, hovering over the dot for the West region in 2011 will display the bar chart for all states in the Western region and their individual earthquake counts in 2011.
