# Interactive-Visualization

a line chart. 

Summarize the data by displaying the count of earthquakes by region for each year. You will need to sum the count of earthquakes by year for all states in their respective regions. Then, display one line for each of the 4 regions in the dataset.


Axes: All axes should automatically adjust based on the data. Do not hard-code any values.

The vertical axis will represent the total count of earthquakes for a region. Display these values using a linear scale.
The horizontal axis will represent the years. Display these values using a time scale.

Interactivity and sub-chart. In the next few parts of this question, you will create event handlers to detect mouseover and mouseout events over each dot shape that you added in Q4.b, so that when hovering over a dot, a horizontal bar chart representing the earthquake count for each state in a region will be shown below the line chart (for the year of that dot). For example, hovering over the dot for the West region in 2011 will display the bar chart for all states in the Western region and their individual earthquake counts in 2011. See Figure 4c for an example.
